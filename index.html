  Hi baby, 
I thought words were the only tools of complimenting a Queen, but each time I look at you, my eyes give compliments I’m fallible to describe. I wish my mouth could tell you how I feel about how you make me feel, but words fail me. I want to touch you in a way that sends my love messages through your skin. I wish I could wake up by your side, it will make my day beautiful like a white wedding gown adorns a wardrobe. I love you like I love to see your face.
I sought for love in this earthly world, then I found you silent in my heart. You’re the peace that covers the noise in my storm, your face sends message that only my heart can explain. I would cover you with love when it’s cold, and when it’s hot, I will keep you under the temperature of love. You unveiled true love to me in the most grandeur manner. I will only ask that you stay with me to share the brightness of this love.
 Nothing is new on earth, but my love for you is newer than a new day. I’ll take you to the front line of my heart and cover you in the depth of my mind. If I lost many things in this world, your place and being in my heart cannot be found wanting. Shielding you is akin to shielding my heart. I blink my eyes because I wanna capture beautiful moments of looking at you. You’re the perfect picture of my heart. I’ll take you from the earth and put you in the heavens of my heart.
